# The Movie DB Swift
> As a mobile engineer you've been tasked with the development of an app for cinephiles and movie hobbyists. This first version (MVP) of the app will be very simple and limited to show the list of upcoming movies. The app will be fed with content from The Movie Database (TMDb). No design specs were given, so you're free to follow your UX and UI personal preferences. However the app should work both in landscape and portrait orientations. The choice of platform (iOS, Android, Xamarin) and development approach is also for you to decide based on previous experience and/or personal interest.

[![CocoaPods Compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/EZSwiftExtensions.svg)](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/LFAlertController.svg)  
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/LFAlertController.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoapods.org/pods/LFAlertController)

The first release of the app will be very limited in scope, but will serve as the foundation for future releases. It's expected that user will be able to:

● Scroll through the list of upcoming movies - including movie name, poster or backdrop image, genre and release date. List should not be limited to show only the first 20 movies as returned by the API. **(Didn't add infinite scroll)**

● Select a specific movie to see details (name, poster image, genre, overview and release date).
